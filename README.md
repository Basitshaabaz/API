This project is a coding challenge that consists of several requirements. It's an Android app that fetches data from NASA's API and displays it in a grid view. The main features of the project are:

## Features

1. Fetch data from the NASA API and display it in a grid.
2. Three tabs, each named after a different vehicle. When clicked, data is fetched from the API.
3. The data from the API response is locally cached.
4. The app checks the data from the API response and local cache and displays it accordingly.
5. The grid includes a filter option based on the camera name.
6. Pagination is implemented for infinite scrolling.
7. FCM service is implemented for a PUSH notification mechanism.
8. The app follows the MVVM architectural pattern and best code practices.

## Installation

Clone this repository and import it into **Android Studio**. 


## Configuring the API Key

In order to make the app work, you need to change the `API_KEY` constant in the `Constants.kt` file with your own API key from NASA.

## Pending Work

The project currently has two areas where work is yet to be done:

- **Unit Tests:** The project does not include unit tests as of yet.
